    "## User Input\n",
    "The user_input() function collects the necessary information about the linear system  𝐴𝑥⃗=𝑏⃗ so that further calculations can be performed. The Jacobi method only works on square matrices (# rows = # columns), so the amount of rows and elements per row in  𝐴  must be equivalent. Vectors  𝑏⃗  and  𝑥⃗ , being single columns, will have as many elements as matrix  𝐴 has rows. For example, if  𝐴  has 3 rows, it will have 3 elements per row, and  𝑏⃗  and  𝑥⃗  will also be comprised of 3 elements. The function takes input specifically for the initial approximation of  𝑥⃗ :  𝑥⃗(0) . An initial guess of all zeros is recommended because it is simple, convenient, and consistent"

    "### Spectral Radius (Jacobi)\n",
    "The spectral radius $r_j$ of the matrix $T_j$, derived from components of user-given matrix $A$, determines whether or not $\\vec{x}$ can be calculated using the Jacobi iterative method.$$T_j = D^{-1}(L + U)$$ The diagonal matrix $D$ must be invertible in order to calculate $T_j$ and $r_j$, so matrix $A$ must contain only non-zero entries along the diagonal. The spectral radius is the maximum of the absolute values of $T_j$'s eigenvalues. In each iteration of the Jacobi method, each approximation of $\\vec{x}$ is proportional to the previous approximation, and the approximations will converge to the true solution. This means that the constant of proportionality (spectral radius, in this case) must be less than 1, or else each iteration will gradually cause $\\vec{x}$ to approach infinity."
